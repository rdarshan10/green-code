Here are some suggestions to further improve the sustainability and efficiency of the provided code changes:

**Reducing computational complexity:**

* Instead of using the `efficient_function` at all, you can directly calculate the count of even numbers using `data // 2` as you've already done. This eliminates the need for a separate function call.

**Minimizing memory usage:**

* Since you're not storing the result of `efficient_function` anywhere, you can remove the `result` variable altogether to reduce memory usage.

**Improving energy efficiency:**

* No additional suggestions in this area, as the improvements made so far have already reduced energy consumption.

**Using more efficient algorithms and data structures:**

* No additional suggestions in this area, as the removal of `numba.jit` has already improved efficiency.

**Reducing redundant operations:**

* You've already removed the redundant operation of summing over the generator expression. However, you can further simplify the code by removing the `main` function and directly printing the result.

Here's the improved version of the code changes:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = 1000
    print(f"Number of even numbers: {data // 2}")

These suggestions should result in an even more sustainable and efficient code.
