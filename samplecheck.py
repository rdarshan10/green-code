Here's the improved version of the code changes, focusing on sustainability and efficiency:

import math

def efficient_function(data):
    # Removed numba.jit as it's not necessary for this simple function
    # Using a generator expression to reduce memory usage
    return (x for x in range(data // 2, data, 2))

data = 1000
result = efficient_function(data)
# Removed redundant operation, directly calculating the count of even numbers
print(f"Number of even numbers: {data // 2}")

Here's a breakdown of the improvements:

1. **Reducing computational complexity**: The original code had two separate function calls, which increased computational complexity. By removing the redundant function call and directly calculating the count of even numbers, we reduced the complexity.
2. **Minimizing memory usage**: Using a generator expression instead of a list comprehension reduces memory usage, as it generates values on-the-fly instead of storing them in memory.
3. **Improving energy efficiency**: By reducing computational complexity and memory usage, we indirectly improve energy efficiency, as the CPU and memory require less power to perform the operations.
4. **Using more efficient algorithms and data structures**: The original code used `numba.jit`, which is not necessary for this simple function. Removing it reduces overhead and improves efficiency.
5. **Reducing redundant operations**: By directly calculating the count of even numbers, we removed the redundant operation of summing over the generator expression.

These changes should result in a more sustainable and efficient code.
