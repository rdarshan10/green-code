I'm happy to help! However, I notice that the provided code is empty. Please provide the actual code you'd like me to analyze and improve for sustainability. I'll be happy to assist you in reducing resource consumption and minimizing environmental impact.

If you meant to provide a blank slate for me to demonstrate sustainable coding practices, here's a simple example of a revised code that incorporates sustainable coding principles:
def sustainable_example(data):
    # Use a generator expression to reduce memory usage
    filtered_data = (x for x in data if x > 5)

    # Use a dictionary comprehension to reduce computational complexity
    result = {x: x**2 for x in filtered_data}

    return result

Please replace this example with your actual code, and I'll be happy to assist you in making it more sustainable.
